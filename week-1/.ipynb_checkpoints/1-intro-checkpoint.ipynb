I have looked upon the world for four</LINE>\\n<LINE>times seven years; and since I could distinguish</LINE>\\n<LINE>betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man</LINE>\\n<LINE>that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I</LINE>\\n<LINE>would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I</LINE>\\n<LINE>would change my humanity with a baboon.</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>RODERIGO</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so</LINE>\\n<LINE>fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>IAGO</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>Virtue! a fig! \\'tis in ourselves that we are thus</LINE>\\n<LINE>or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which</LINE>\\n<LINE>our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant</LINE>\\n<LINE>nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up</LINE>\\n<LINE>thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or</LINE>\\n<LINE>distract it with many, either to have it sterile</LINE>\\n<LINE>with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the</LINE>\\n<LINE>power and corrigible authority of this lies in our</LINE>\\n<LINE>wills. If the balance of our lives had not one</LINE>\\n<LINE>scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the</LINE>\\n<LINE>blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us</LINE>\\n<LINE>to most preposterous conclusions: but we have</LINE>\\n<LINE>reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal</LINE>\\n<LINE>stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that</LINE>\\n<LINE>you call love to be a sect or scion.</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>RODERIGO</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>It cannot be.</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>IAGO</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of</LINE>\\n<LINE>the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown</LINE>\\n<LINE>cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy</LINE>\\n<LINE>friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with</LINE>\\n<LINE>cables of perdurable toughness; I could never</LINE>\\n<LINE>better stead thee than now. Put money in thy</LINE>\\n<LINE>purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with</LINE>\\n<LINE>an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It</LINE>\\n<LINE>cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her</LINE>\\n<LINE>love to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor he</LINE>\\n<LINE>his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou</LINE>\\n<LINE>shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but</LINE>\\n<LINE>money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in</LINE>\\n<LINE>their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food</LINE>\\n<LINE>that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be</LINE>\\n<LINE>to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must</LINE>\\n<LINE>change for youth: when she is sated with his body,</LINE>\\n<LINE>she will find the error of her choice: she must</LINE>\\n<LINE>have change, she must: therefore put money in thy</LINE>\\n<LINE>purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a</LINE>\\n<LINE>more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money</LINE>\\n<LINE>thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt</LINE>\\n<LINE>an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not</LINE>\\n<LINE>too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou</LINE>\\n<LINE>shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of</LINE>\\n<LINE>drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek</LINE>\\n<LINE>thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than</LINE>\\n<LINE>to be drowned and go without her.</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>RODERIGO</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on</LINE>\\n<LINE>the issue?</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>IAGO</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>Thou art sure of me:--go, make money:--I have told</LINE>\\n<LINE>thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I</LINE>\\n<LINE>hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no</LINE>\\n<LINE>less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge</LINE>\\n<LINE>against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost</LINE>\\n<LINE>thyself a pleasure, me a sport.

It</LINE>\\n<LINE>is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the</LINE>\\n<LINE>mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but</LINE>\\n<LINE>competency lives longer.</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>PORTIA</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>Good sentences and well pronounced.</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>NERISSA</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>They would be better, if well followed.</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>PORTIA</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>If to do were as easy as to know what were good to</LINE>\\n<LINE>do, chapels had been churches and poor men\\'s</LINE>\\n<LINE>cottages princes\\' palaces. It is a good divine that</LINE>\\n<LINE>follows his own instructions: I can easier teach</LINE>\\n<LINE>twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the</LINE>\\n<LINE>twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may</LINE>\\n<LINE>devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps</LINE>\\n<LINE>o\\'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the</LINE>\\n<LINE>youth, to skip o\\'er the meshes of good counsel the</LINE>\\n<LINE>cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to</LINE>\\n<LINE>choose me a husband. O me, the word \\'choose!\\' I may</LINE>\\n<LINE>neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I</LINE>\\n<LINE>dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed</LINE>\\n<LINE>by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,</LINE>\\n<LINE>Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>NERISSA</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their</LINE>\\n<LINE>death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,</LINE>\\n<LINE>that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,</LINE>\\n<LINE>silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning</LINE>\\n<LINE>chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any</LINE>\\n<LINE>rightly but one who shall rightly love.

I am much afeard my lady his</LINE>\\n<LINE>mother played false with a smith.</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>NERISSA</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>Then there is the County Palatine.</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>PORTIA</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>He doth nothing but frown, as who should say \\'If you</LINE>\\n<LINE>will not have me, choose:\\' he hears merry tales and</LINE>\\n<LINE>smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping</LINE>\\n<LINE>philosopher when he grows old, being so full of</LINE>\\n<LINE>unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be</LINE>\\n<LINE>married to a death\\'s-head with a bone in his mouth</LINE>\\n<LINE>than to either of these. God defend me from these</LINE>\\n<LINE>two!</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>NERISSA</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>PORTIA</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.</LINE>\\n<LINE>In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,</LINE>\\n<LINE>he! why, he hath a horse better than the</LINE>\\n<LINE>Neapolitan\\'s, a better bad habit of frowning than</LINE>\\n<LINE>the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a</LINE>\\n<LINE>throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will</LINE>\\n<LINE>fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I</LINE>\\n<LINE>should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me</LINE>\\n<LINE>I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I</LINE>\\n<LINE>shall never requite him.</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>NERISSA</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron</LINE>\\n<LINE>of England?</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>PORTIA</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>You know I say nothing to him, for he understands</LINE>\\n<LINE>not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,</LINE>\\n<LINE>nor Italian, and you will come into the court and</LINE>\\n<LINE>swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.</LINE>\\n<LINE>He is a proper man\\'s picture, but, alas, who can</LINE>\\n<LINE>converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!</LINE>\\n<LINE>I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round</LINE>\\n<LINE>hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his</LINE>\\n<LINE>behavior every where.</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>NERISSA</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>PORTIA</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he</LINE>\\n<LINE>borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and</LINE>\\n<LINE>swore he would pay him again when he was able: I</LINE>\\n<LINE>think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed</LINE>\\n<LINE>under for another.</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>NERISSA</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony\\'s nephew?</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>PORTIA</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and</LINE>\\n<LINE>most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when</LINE>\\n<LINE>he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and</LINE>\\n<LINE>when he is worst, he is little better than a beast:</LINE>\\n<LINE>and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall</LINE>\\n<LINE>make shift to go without him.</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>NERISSA</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>If he should offer to choose, and choose the right</LINE>\\n<LINE>casket, you should refuse to perform your father\\'s</LINE>\\n<LINE>will, if you should refuse to accept him.</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>PORTIA</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a</LINE>\\n<LINE>deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,</LINE>\\n<LINE>for if the devil be within and that temptation</LINE>\\n<LINE>without, I know he will choose it.

I am a Jew.

If we are like you in the rest, we will</LINE>\\n<LINE>resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,</LINE>\\n<LINE>what is his humility? Revenge.

In religion,</LINE>\\n<LINE>What damned error, but some sober brow</LINE>\\n<LINE>Will bless it and approve it with a text,</LINE>\\n<LINE>Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?</LINE>\\n<LINE>There is no vice so simple but assumes</LINE>\\n<LINE>Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:</LINE>\\n<LINE>How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false</LINE>\\n<LINE>As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins</LINE>\\n<LINE>The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;</LINE>\\n<LINE>Who, inward search\\'d, have livers white as milk;</LINE>\\n<LINE>And these assume but valour\\'s excrement</LINE>\\n<LINE>To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,</LINE>\\n<LINE>And you shall see \\'tis purchased by the weight;</LINE>\\n<LINE>Which therein works a miracle in nature,</LINE>\\n<LINE>Making them lightest that wear most of it:</LINE>\\n<LINE>So are those crisped snaky golden locks</LINE>\\n<LINE>Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,</LINE>\\n<LINE>Upon supposed fairness, often known</LINE>\\n<LINE>To be the dowry of a second head,</LINE>\\n<LINE>The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.</LINE>\\n<LINE>Thus ornament is but the guiled shore</LINE>\\n<LINE>To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf</LINE>\\n<LINE>Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,</LINE>\\n<LINE>The seeming truth which cunning times put on</LINE>\\n<LINE>To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,</LINE>\\n<LINE>Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;</LINE>\\n<LINE>Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge</LINE>\\n<LINE>\\'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,</LINE>\\n<LINE>Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,</LINE>\\n<LINE>Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;</LINE>\\n<LINE>And here choose I; joy be the consequence!</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>PORTIA</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  How all the other passions fleet to air,</LINE>\\n<LINE>As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,</LINE>\\n<LINE>And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy!

An I had been a man of any</LINE>\\n<LINE>occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,</LINE>\\n<LINE>I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so</LINE>\\n<LINE>he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,</LINE>\\n<LINE>If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired</LINE>\\n<LINE>their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three</LINE>\\n<LINE>or four wenches, where I stood, cried \\'Alas, good</LINE>\\n<LINE>soul!\\' and forgave him with all their hearts: but</LINE>\\n<LINE>there\\'s no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had</LINE>\\n<LINE>stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>And after that, he came, thus sad, away?</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>Ay.</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>Did Cicero say any thing?</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>Ay, he spoke Greek.</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>To what effect?</LINE>\\n</SPEECH>\\n\\n<SPEECH>\\n<SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>\\n<LINE>Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne\\'er look you i\\' the</LINE>\\n<LINE>face again: but those that understood him smiled at</LINE>\\n<LINE>one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own</LINE>\\n<LINE>part, it was Greek to me.
